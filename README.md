# Dot files
Just a collection of my personal dotfiles, in the form they may take

These are currently very much personalized, and will probably won't work since I hardcoded my username. 

That said, whenever I start showing my dot files, I'll have changed this. Honestly,
idk how you've found this repo lol.

# Warning regarding ignis
Whenever I develop something, I usually implement it right into my workflow, even before it's merged (
with whatever that entails for work down the line). This means, that, for ignis specifically, if you get
any error for "xxx" not found, check into the 'ignis-next' branch.
